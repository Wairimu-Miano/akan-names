#### By Wairimu Miano
## Description
This web application on the user interface has some information about what it does on its homepage, then there is a form where he/she chooses their gender and enters their date of birth. This information then goes to business logic for processing. Thereafter the user is alerted of their Akan name through a popup alert. I used a date input type on the date of birth form to prevent a user from entering a wrong date. All fields also have to be filled otherwise an error message is displayed.

###Business Driven Development
When we focus on the behavior we want in our results, we want it to produce an Akan name for any date of birth entered.With this knowledge we then figure out how the program will produce the required results. The project utilises BDD as the user provides various inputs: Date of birth;year,month,date and also gender. This is then used to produce outputs:day of the week the user was born along with the Akan name
## Technologies Used
In the creation of this project, I used the following programming languages:HTML,CSS, JavaScript. I also used bootstrap in styling sheets.
